Context Overview
The Perfect Meal application is designed to help reduce the amount of time spent on trying to plan out meals for a given week. By utilizing randomized recipe cards and a weekly planner view, users can select from recipes that are in the database and assign them to the day in the week of their choosing.
Problem to Solve
In todayâ€™s society, it is quite common for people to be working over 40 hours a week. With the amount of time spent working and on other responsibilities, it can be hard to find time to plan out meals for the week or even find inspiration on ideas for meals. We often see people resort to low-priced fast-food due to lack of time or inspiration, which can be very unhealthy; however, with a bit of planning through a convenient web application this can be avoided.
Solution
Our web application is designed to help people find inspiration for their meals by providing a wide variety of recipes right in front of the user, as well as reduce the time it takes to plan out meals for the week. This application will also provide a platform for users to share their recipes and find recipes from others.
